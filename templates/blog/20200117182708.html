<h2>Using Let's encrypt to get an SSL certificate - CentOS 7</h2>

To support HTTPS, let's install certbot to use Let's encrypt, which allows you to get an SSL certificate for free.

<pre>
sudo yum -y install epel-release
sudo yum -y install certbot python-certbot-apache
</pre>

<h3>Let's encrypt requires a web server to obtain a certificate</h3>

Let's encrypt issues SSL certificates by verifying that you have access to a web server with an HTTP connection.

Therefore, you need a web server to listen for HTTP connections.

Install <a href="/blog/20200115175810.html">Aapche</a> as your web server.

For HTTPS connection, mod_ssl is required, so install <a href="/blog/20200112182708.html">mod_ssl</a>.

As a common server configuration, let's consider the case where a reverse proxy is used to listen.

Set up the following in /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf to receive "www.mydomain.example" on the default port 80 of HTTP, and then on port 10000 of the application server behind it.

<pre>
  <VirtualHost *:80
    ServerName www.mydomain.example
    
    <Proxy *>
      Require all granted
    </Proxy

    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:10000/ keepalive=On
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:10000/
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
  </VirtualHost
</pre>

We will not configure the settings for loading the SSL certificate at this point, as it does not exist.

After configuring the settings, <a href="/blog/20200115175810.html">restart Apache</a> and go to "http://www.mydomain.example" and make sure you can connect. Before restarting, it is a good idea to <a href="/blog/20200114175810.html">check</a> that the Apache configuration file is correct.

Here is a simple example of starting a server with Mojolicious, which is a reverse proxy and connects to a web application.

<pre>
# myapp.pl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

app->start;
</pre>

Launch

<pre>
hypnotoad myapp.pl
</pre>

The default port for the <a href="https://en.webapp.perlzemi.com/">Mojolicious</a> hypnotoad server is 10000, but if you want to specify the port number, edit "hypnotoad.conf".

<h3>Obtain an SSL certificate</h3>

Let's use certbot to get an SSL certificate, and it will automatically add the configuration for HTTPS connection for Apache.

<pre>
sudo certbot run --apache -d www.mydomain.example
</pre>

You will be asked for your email address first. Type in your email address and Enter.

The SSL certificate will be stored in the following directory

<pre>
/etc/letsencrypt/live
</pre>

If you look at it, you will see that it is stored in separate directories for each domain.

<pre> /etc/letsencrypt/live
sudo ls /etc/letsencrypt/live
</pre>
