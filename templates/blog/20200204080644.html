<h2>Updating a minor version of CentOS - CentOS 7, Cent OS 8</h2>.

To upgrade a minor version of CentOS, use "yum update".

<pre
sudo yum update
</pre>

CentOS will be updated to the latest minor version.

All dependent packages of CentOS, including the kernel, will be up to date.

<h3>Try updating the production environment in the development environment first</h3>.

If you update your production environment out of the blue, it will break your environment and cause a lot of trouble.

First of all, update your environment in the development environment to make sure it works for your critical applications.

<pre>.
# Restart Apache
sudo systemctl reload httpd

# Check that Apache is restarted
sudo systemctl status httpd

# Restart Mariadb
sudo systemctl restart mariadb

# Check if Mariadb is restarted
sudo systemctl status mariadb

# Restart Postfix
systemctl restart postfix

# Check Postfix
systemctl status postfix

# Restart a web application
hypnotoad myapp.pl
</pre>.

After confirming that it works correctly in the development environment, run it in the production environment.

<h3>Apache failed to start</h3>.

It is possible that the Apache version has been upgraded and the incompatible part of the configuration file is causing the error.

Let's check the status of Apache.

<pre
systemctl status httpd
</pre>

Here is a sample of the error

<pre> systemctl status httpd
Feb 04 08:13:28 tk2-261-xxxxx.vs.sakura.ne.jp systemd[1]: Starting The Apache HTTP Server...

</pre>.

I wonder what's going on with "/etc/httpd/conf.d/autoindex.conf", maybe Aapche was upgraded and a different configuration file was loaded without my permission?

I also got this error

<pre>.

</pre>.

Oh, port 443 is already bound? What if the default ssl.conf has been loaded by itself?

This can happen, so try it in the development environment first, and then update the production environment.

<h3>Checking the version of CentOS</h3>.

Use the following command to check if you have updated to the latest version.

<pre>.
cat /etc/redhat-release
</pre>.

You are now on the latest version.

<pre> cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)
</pre>
